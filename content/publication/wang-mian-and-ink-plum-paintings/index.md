abstract: For Chinese people, the flowering plum tree has been one of the
  favorite blossoms for more than a millennium. The plum, usually blooming at
  the end of the winter when the world is still covered by the snow and tingling
  the air with a faint scent, symbolizes the arrival of the Chinese lunar new
  year and a turning point from winter to spring. For its auspicious feature,
  countless paintings use flowering plum as the motif, and elegant works of this
  subject by many known artists, like Yang Wujiu, Emperor Huizong, Ma Yuan,
  exist today. However, it is commonly acknowledged that Wang Mian, a later Yuan
  dynasty scholar, is the most pivotal and representational artist for the plum
  painting tradition. James Cahill refers Wang Mian to “the most famous of Yuan
  plum painters” ; Maggie Bickford titles him as the “founder of the modern ink
  plum tradition.”  The use of the term “ink plum” here, instead of blooming
  plum, articulates a significant category of Chinese painting in which Wang
  Mian was a prominent figure.
