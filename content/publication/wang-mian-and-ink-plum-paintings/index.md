abstract: It is commonly acknowledged that Wang Mian, a later Yuan dynasty scholar, is the most pivotal and representational artist for the plum painting tradition. James Cahill refers Wang Mian to “the most famous of Yuan plum painters” ; Maggie Bickford titles him as the “founder of the modern ink plum tradition.”  The use of the term “ink plum” here, instead of blooming plum, articulates a significant category of Chinese painting in which Wang Mian was a prominent figure.
