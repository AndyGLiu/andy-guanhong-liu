abstract: It is commonly acknowledged that Wang Mian, a later Yuan
  dynasty scholar, is the most pivotal and representational artist for the plum
  painting tradition. James Cahill refers Wang Mian to “the most famous of Yuan
  plum painters” ; Maggie Bickford titles him as the “founder of the modern ink
  plum tradition.”  The use of the term “ink plum” here, instead of blooming
  plum, articulates a significant category of Chinese painting in which Wang
  Mian was a prominent figure.
