abstract: Wang Mian, a later Yuan dynasty scholar, is commonly acknowledged as
  the most pivotal and representational artist for the plum painting tradition.
  James Cahill refers Wang Mian to “the most famous of Yuan plum painters”;
  Maggie Bickford titles him as the “founder of the modern ink plum tradition.”
  The use of the term “ink plum” here, instead of blooming plum, articulates a
  significant category of Chinese painting in which Wang Mian was a prominent
  figure.
